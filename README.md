# jupyterlab-module-federation

This repository is a temporary playground for implementing a new JupyterLab extension
system that utilizes the Module Federation capabilities in WebPack 5.

We will be making PRs to `jupyterlab_server` and `jupyterlab` once this work is stable.

See https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/7468 for full background and discussion.
