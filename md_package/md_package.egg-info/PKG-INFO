Description: ## md_package
        
        A federated markdown package
        
        ## Prequisites
        - JupyterLab 3+
        - node 12+
        
        ## Installation
        - `pip install -e . && python ../labextensions.py develop .`
        
        ## Develop
        - Run `jlpm run watch:all` to watch the source and build to static.
        
        
        ## Notes
        - Assets are built into `md_package/static` so that the package is self-contained.  They are also shipped in `data_files` so the package is automatically installed as
        a lab extension.
        - Need to use the script from from `@jupyterlab/buildutils` when available
        - Need to use `jupyter labextension develop` when available
        - `pip install .` is broken - complains about `tsserver`
        - Since `symlink=True` by default, there is no need to do anything special on the JupyterLab side,
        just refresh the page when the extension assets update
